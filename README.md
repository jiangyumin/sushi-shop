# sushi-shop
Spring Boot, JPA and H2 to build the simple application.

The program should be built using the following frameworks/libraries/tools:
  • Spring boot
  • H2 database
  • Maven/Gradle
  • Any other libraries you feel you may need
  
Requirements:
  1. The server should start on port 9000
  2. Use an embedded in-memory H2 database with the following SQL to initialize the
database when the server starts:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sushi;
CREATE TABLE sushi (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(30),
time_to_make INT DEFAULT NULL
);
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sushi_order;
CREATE TABLE sushi_order (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
status_id INT NOT NULL,
sushi_id INT NOT NULL,
createdAt TIMESTAMP NOT NULL default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS status;
CREATE TABLE status (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO sushi (name, time_to_make) VALUES
('California Roll', 30),
('Kamikaze Roll', 40),
('Dragon Eye', 50);
INSERT INTO status (name) VALUES
('created'),
('in-progress'),
('paused'),
('finished'),
('cancelled');
3. REST APIs:
a. All the response bodies should include the following fields:
i. code: 0 for success, and any other integers for failures
ii. msg: A meaningful message represents the result
b. Build the following REST APIs that accepts and returns JSON data:
i. Submitting an order: POST /api/orders:
§ Request body:
{
"sushi_name": "California Roll"
}
§ Response:
- Code: 200
- Body:
{
"order": {
"id": 10,
"statusId": 1,
"sushiId": 1,
"createdAt": 1582643059540
},
"code": 0,
"msg": "Order submitted"
}
§ Only three orders can be processed at the same time
§ When an order is submitted, the order record should be saved into
database with status set to “created”
§ When a chef is ready to process an order, the corresponding order
record should be updated in the database with status set to “inprogress”
§ The field “time_to_make” from sushi table represents how long it
takes to make a specific kind of sushi. For example, a California Roll
takes 30 seconds to make, thus a chef will be occupied for 30 seconds
to finish making the sushi
§ When an order is completed, the corresponding order record should
be updated in the database with status set to “finished”
ii. Cancelling an order: PUT /api/orders/cancel/{order_id}
§ Path parameter order_id
§ Response:
- Code: 200
- Body:
{
"code": 0,
"msg": "Order cancelled"
}
§ The chef who is working on making the ordered sushi should stop
upon cancellation request
§ The order should be updated in the database with status set to
“cancelled”
iii. Pausing an order: PUT /api/orders/pause/{order_id}
§ Path parameter order_id
§ Response:
- Code: 200
- Body:
{
"code": 0,
"msg": "Order paused"
}
§ When an order needs to be paused, the chef must pause the progress
of making the sushi until the order is resumed
§ The order should be updated in the database with status set to
“paused”
iv. Resuming an order: PUT /api/orders/resume/{order_id}
§ Path parameter order_id
§ Response:
- Code: 200
- Body:
{
"code": 0,
"msg": "Order resumed"
}
§ When a resuming order request is received, the chef should continue
to process the order with high priority. A resumed order should only
be processed base on the remaining processing time. For example, an
order of California Roll is paused after 20 seconds since the order
became in-progress, then it should take 10 more seconds to finish
once resumed.
§ The order should be updated in the database with status set to “inprogress”
v. Displaying all orders: GET /api/orders/status
§ Response:
- Code: 200
- Body:
{
"in-progress": [
{
"orderId": 4,
"timeSpent": 23
},
{
"orderId": 5,
"timeSpent": 21
}
],
"pending": [
{
"orderId": 6,
"timeSpent": 0
}
],
"paused": [
{
"orderId": 2,
"timeSpent": 5
}
],
"cancelled": [
{
"orderId": 3,
"timeSpent": 6
}
],
"completed": [
{
"orderId": 1,
"timeSpent": 30
}
]
}
Evaluation:
1. Code completion and correctness
2. Code brevity and clarity
3. Code efficiency and readability
